# Hi there!

My name is Alena Hasslacher, I'm a fullstack web-developer from Vienna, Austria.

I originally come from Russia, but have been living in Austria since 2015. Having worked in Human Resources in a bank in Moscow, I pursued my degree in Linguistics at the University of Vienna and later worked for Austrian Airlines. I've been always curious about web-development, but never was brave enough to try. It all changed in May 2020 when I joined the Upleveled Coding Bootcamp, where I learned all about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, PostgresQL, GraphQL, Node.js,and many other technologies. And now I'm the one doing the Internet, too!
I am passionate about coding, books, cats, and good (vegan) food.
My motto is: 'It's okay to eat a whole pizza by yourself'.
